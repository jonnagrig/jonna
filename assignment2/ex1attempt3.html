<div id="first">
<p>Cut ¾ of the &nbsp;<em>300G PEELED BEETROOT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; into small dice (you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) and set the rest aside. Melt the &nbsp;<em>50G OF BUTTER</em>&nbsp; in a large pan, and then soften the &nbsp;<em>1 SMALL ONION</em>&nbsp; over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.</p></div>

Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry. Meanwhile, grate the remaining 75g of beetroot.</p></div>

<div id="third">
<p>Pour in the rest of the &nbsp;<em>1.5L OF GELATINOUS BEEF STOCK</em>&nbsp; and the &nbsp;<em>2 PEELED AND DICED MEDIUM FLOURY POTATOES (eg Maris Piper)</em>&nbsp; and simmer for 15 minutes, then add the &nbsp;<em>½ SMALL SHREDDED CABBAGE, 4 PEELED AND CRUSHED CLOVES OF GARLIC</em>&nbsp; and grated beetroot.
