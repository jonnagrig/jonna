<h3>Week 4</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week was very experimental for me in regards to code. Working on my project for studio was a very interesting experience for I felt this was the first time since last semester that I had to actually come up with a vison in my head of what I wanted and code it from  scratch. I got the skeleton of my "it's as if you're being swallowed" website set up pretty quickly. My main issue I had was figuring out how to make only one small piece of an image clickable. I tinkered with using invisible div boxes but couldn't quite get them to align properly when resizing the window. Then I searched high and low for a soultion and found out that I can create image maps and link particular coordinates of an image. I struggled with that until I finally got it to work, and then it was still acting funny when resized. At my midway-meeting with Gary he suggested I just go back to using invisible boxes as links. I took his advice and backtracked, which later proved useful when I had to figure out how to hover over one div and make another change in response.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately I like how my first assignment ended up. I'm still having trouble with positioning. I managed to use it to get all the pieces to the puzzle where I want them to be, I just can't figure out quite how to get them to act how I want them to when resizing the window. But on the bright side, I took much diligence this time around to make my  code much neater! At the beginning of this assignmnet I had about 8 different CSS windows. Eventually something clicked in my brain and I realized that was totally ridiculous and narrowed it down to a whopping ONE CSS page. Something else I did to stay organized was use commenting in style sheet. I sort of neglected that feature in my previous classes and now I'm not sure why because it proved quite useful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played Grid Garden and Flexbox Froggy and like working on my "It's as if" project, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. It did a good job of explaining how each funtion works and I found myself zipping throug the game. However, I'm quite sure that if I had to apply these skills to real-world coding I would most definitely need to look back on the game or google how to use the functions until they stuck (like any new bit of code). I wonder in what scenarios grids and flexboxes make the most sense to use. I guess I will find out in time.</p>

<h3>Week 3</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I unexpectedly found this week's homework assignment more difficult than last week's. I thought I would have even more fun this time around but even though we had more information to work with I felt just as, if not more restricted, than last time. I think I just have less practice with, and therefore retained less knowledge about CSS. I felt more comfortable in only HTML but I am glad we are slowly being pushed more and more each week. In the end I still ended up coming up with at least a couple of pages I like. Again, I had a problem coming up with ten different variations, and I used some code from the previous assignment which didn't help my feeling of repetitiveness. But because I felt so much less comfortable integrating CSS, it was taking me much longer to do each page. So I used my resources to ensure I could complete the entirety of the assignment on time. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One problem with this is that it did result in some messy code, I do admit. I am aware, especially after doing the reading, that there are several places I used html properties when I could have used CSS. I will try to better weigh the pros and cons of which ways I write my code in future and try to keep it much nearer and tighter from now on. I especially would like to take time to clean up the code on this personal site since I know I will being going back to it often and don't want to end up confusing myself. (P.S. I think I have Divitis. I will need to figure out how to cure that...)</p> 

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was relieved that we went over CSS positioning in class this week because that was by far the thing I had the most trouble with last semester. I never did fully get a grip of what the difference between each position property was but doing the jam exercise, following along, and taking notes in class REALLY helped clarifiy that for me. I'm still no expert but I do feel I'm gaining knowledge with each week.</p>

<h3>Week 2</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week I feel confident in using GitHub. I tinkered with it a lot outside of class and troubleshot until I understood it better. I still don't fully understand how to use it to its fullest capabilities, but I am glad I have somewhat figured out GitPages and how to push my progress onto my repositories. Going over it again in class also helped me a lot. I find it essential to write down each step one by one and very clearly so I can look back on it until I don't need to anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the homework went, I did something extremely similar for my first coding assignment last semester and I found that it took me a fraction of the time to do it this time around. I suppose I retained more from creative computing than I thought. It was a little tricky for me to come up with ten whole entirely different concepts, so I do feel some pages turned out weaker than others. But still, I am happy with what I could do with so many restrictions. That being said, I think we are going at a good pace in class and I'm glad we didn't jump right into using CSS right away, I would be feeling a lot more intimidated and overwhelmed with the homework if that were the case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm enjoying working on my personal website in my own time. I think since it's not an official assignment to make it beautiful and perfect under a tight time restriction I am experimenting more and actually coding in my free time, which is not something I ever did before. I'm currently pushing my old homepage code to upload homework so that my experimental mid-code work doesn't make the site impossible to navigate.</p>

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first week of class we learned about what a website is. It was a good refresher to talk about things from the ground up, since I feel like I have forgotten a lot of what I learned in creative computing last year. I am excited to finally create a personal website that represents me. Last semester I didn't make many interactive webpages so I hope to make more things I'm proud of in studio and lab this semester. I am extremely confused about GitHub and git but it seems like everyone else is, too at this point, so at least I don't feel off track from the rest of the class.</p>
