<h3>Week 3</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I unexpectedly found this week's homework assignment more difficult than last week's. I thought I would have even more fun this time around but even though we had more information to work with I felt just as, if not more restricted, than last time. I think I just have less practice with, and therefore retained less knowledge about CSS. I felt more comfortable in only HTML but I am glad we are slowly being pushed more and more each week. Again, I had a problem coming up with ten different variations, and I used some code from the previous assignment which didn't help my feelig of repetitiveness. But because I felt so much less comfortable integrating CSS, it was taking me much longer to do each page. So I used my resources to ensure I could complete the entirety of the assignment on time. Though I think I have less pages I'm proud of for assignment 2 than I had for assignment 1, still did end up with a couple pages I like the outcome of.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was relieved that we went over CSS positioning in class this week because that was by far the thing I had the most trouble with last semester. I never did fully get a grip of what the difference between each position property was but doing the jam exercise, following along, and taking notes in class REALLY helped clarifiy that for me. I'm still no expert but I do feel I'm gaining knowledge with each week.

<h3>Week 2</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week I feel confident in using GitHub. I tinkered with it a lot outside of class and troubleshot until I understood it better. I still don't fully understand how to use it to its fullest capabilities, but I am glad I have somewhat figured out GitPages and how to push my progress onto my repositories. Going over it again in class also helped me a lot. I find it essential to write down each step one by one and very clearly so I can look back on it until I don't need to anymore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the homework went, I did something extremely similar for my first coding assignment last semester and I found that it took me a fraction of the time to do it this time around. I suppose I retained more from creative computing than I thought. It was a little tricky for me to come up with ten whole entirely different concepts, so I do feel some pages turned out weaker than others. But still, I am happy with what I could do with so many restrictions. That being said, I think we are going at a good pace in class and I'm glad we didn't jump right into using CSS right away, I would be feeling a lot more intimidated and overwhelmed with the homework if that were the case.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm enjoying working on my personal website in my own time. I think since it's not an official assignment to make it beautiful and perfect under a tight time restriction I am experimenting more and actually coding in my free time, which is not something I ever did before. I'm currently pushing my old homepage code to upload homework so that my experimental mid-code work doesn't make the site impossible to navigate.

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first week of class we learned about what a website is. It was a good refresher to talk about things from the ground up, since I feel like I have forgotten a lot of what I learned in creative computing last year. I am excited to finally create a personal website that represents me. Last semester I didn't make many interactive webpages so I hope to make more things I'm proud of in studio and lab this semester. I am extremely confused about GitHub and git but it seems like everyone else is, too at this point, so at least I don't feel off track from the rest of the class.
