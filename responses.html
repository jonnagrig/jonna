<h3>Response to <a href="https://www.are.na/block/6240398"> Claire Evans Reading</a> (studio)</h3>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I respect everybody’s opinions I will start off this reading response by saying that I did not exactly find this text to be as fun and fast-paced as it was led on to be. It felt more to me as if I was standing in a circle with a group of friends and everyone except me was in the same major and I was trying to make sense of what they were talking about. Another way to explain my feeling while reading Chapter 10 of <em>Broad Band</em>  is that I felt like it was meant to be read by someone who already knows a lot about the computer science field. I felt I was being taught a lot about the interesting history behind hyperlinks and the web without fully understanding yet what either one actually is in the first place. About halfway through the text, Claire Evans wrote a line that perfectly described my feeling: “All of this might sound bogglingly abstract and strange.”  Yes, it did. Although there was a bit of explanation of each, I just don’t think I can fully grasp the concepts through text alone. I have a suspicion that they would be better understood through actually interacting with and looking at the difference between hyperlinks and the web. 
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I even found myself wishing the text was accompanied by a hyperlinked version of the history of the web. This is because Evans would introduce an idea or creation that was made by a prominent female designer, like Wendy Hall’s microcosm or Cathy Marshall’s Notecards, and then would say how Apple or another big software company soon after implemented similar technologies into their mainstream devices. But Evans never exactly stated that these larger companies were directly inspired by Wendy or Cathy. I don’t doubt that they were, and I honestly assume that they were! But I would be interested to see a map of who was inspired by whose ideas, who was coincidentally coming up with the same things at the same time, who actually popularized each idea first, etc. The history in the reading just got me a little jumbled.  <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I still did learn a lot from <em>Broad Band</em> and it did give me a good picture of just how much life changed in so little time. The sheer fact that these advances were all accomplished in only a few short decades amazes me. It reminded me a lot of Kevin Kelly’s talk, “The next 5000 days of the web,” and makes me wonder what more there is to come.  <br><br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately upon reading “Metaphors We Live By” by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson I was stricken with a sense that up to this point in my life I have not been observant enough in regards to my own first language. By time I had gotten a few pages deep, my entire understanding of what a metaphor is had expanded greatly. In fact, only now do I realize that my use of phrases like “a few pages deep” and “expanded my understanding” are indeed metaphors of their own that have unique historical and cultural backgrounds. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coincidentally, the morning before I read this text I read a chapter from a novel I’m working on in my free time. This novel features a quirky, odd-duck type character who despises the frequent metaphors and ambiguity the English language contains. He mentions his adoration of the language of Loglan, which was apparently developed specifically to avoid this kind of abstruseness that can be found in the way we tend to use our words in context to other things (i.e. “time is money”). When I read this part of the novel I wondered to myself if things would be better if humans were more just straight-to-the-point with the things we say, if the world would be improved if each concept/object/idea had just one way to communicate it verbally and we never deviated from this organized system. But after reading “Metaphors We Live By” I have decided that I enjoy humans’ diverse use of rhetorical questions, figures of speech, and symbolic phrases. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lakoff and Johnson insisted in this reading that metaphors in everyday language are “not poetic, fanciful, or rhetorical,” only “literal” and based off of our culture and experiences. But I find even just that to be special. The way we force unrelated things to be related and then teach our children to do the same may not be purposely “poetic” in nature, but I still find it to be an interesting behavior that only the human species undertakes. I suppose it does have the potential to cause confusion from culture to culture, however I also like to view it as an excuse to teach each other and make time to learn about the different ways of thinking that exist between us all. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When thinking of web design, it is important to understand what your website conveys and how the setup and visuals of your site can enhance or diminish the point you want to get across with it. I think when creating my own personal site for Core Interaction I should envision it through the eyes of others and ask myself if I am portraying ‘me’ in an effective way. And like how I have learned to just accept metaphors as they appear to me in everyday language, I need to figure out all the little nuances in HTML and CSS that will help me understand how the interface’s capabilities can allow me to create something I’m proud of. In the way that there is a meaning behind each metaphor, I know there is a meaning behind each opening and closing tag, each style element, all which I am on my way to understanding. I can only learn through more and more practice and repetition, and slowly getting to know this new language like I once learned to understand my own.</p><br><br>




<h3>Response to <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/b/bf/Bateson_Gregory_Steps_to_an_Ecology_of_Mind.pdf"> Bateson Reading (Why a Swan)</a> (studio)</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metalogue between Gregory Bateson and his daughter titled “Why a Swan?” I found to be quite philosophical. I picked out certain similar ideas from this reading and the Lakoff and Johnson reading. Specifically the idea that different words and phrases are thought of differently from culture to culture. Bateson mentioning how the French take the words “sort of” to be deeply offensive, while in English this is not the case, reminded me of how in “Metaphors We Live By” some cultures think of the future as being in front of us while others think of the future as being behind us. The main realization I made is that we tend to rely on the assumption that others will understand what we are trying to convey, even if we are not necessarily using the correct language to express our thoughts. I think communication relies a lot on body language, patterns, and a level of understanding between two people to effectively get a message across. Because people have these capabilities, we can express ideas to one another, even without using verbal communication to its most effective measure. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when thinking about this in terms of computers and the web, programmers and coders must understand that a computer is a machine. This means that there is not an attempt to understand each other coming from both sides, programming is a one-sided relationship. A programmer must know all the exact right words to communicate to the computer, because such a machine does not have the other means of understanding you like a fellow human has. You cannot assume the computer knows what word you meant to use when you used the wrong one, you cannot use hand signals to get your point across to the computer. There is no room for misinterpretation. This is when a universal language actually does come in handy, and I suppose this is why coders from all over the world use HTML, CSS, etc. and not their own languages to tell their computers what to do.</p><br><br>


<h3>Response to <a href="https://2x4.org/ideas/2009/fuck-content/"> Rock Reading</a> (studio)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I really enjoyed reading Michael Rock’s “Fuck Content.” As soon as I read the first couple of paragraphs I had many thoughts drifting through my mind. Rock opens by discussing another writing of his where he suggests that as designers, “we are insecure about the value of our work.” Immediately I thought of an Airtable discussion I attended last semester in which one of the panelists talked about imposter syndrome and how almost every designer has it. I took great solace in the idea that I am probably never the only person in the room secretly doubting their own abilities. I also thought back to when I was applying for art schools and felt that each and every piece of work in my portfolio had to have the most elaborate and in-depth backstory/meaning behind it. Trying to get others to take your work seriously can get very exhausting at times, and what I am starting to learn and hope to convey with my personal website in this class is that sometimes the work can just speak for itself.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing Rock mentioned in this reading is how many people totally misperceived his book, ​Designer as Author​. Apparently, readers of this book took it as advice to become “designers and authors” instead of “designers as authors.” This line sparked yet another memory of mine, this one a bit more recent. For Agnes’s lab homework last week I wrote a response to Sara De Bondt’s personal website. I took note in my response that Bondt calls herself an author whereas I see her work as more of the work of a designer. After reading “Fuck Content” I do see how she can fit Rock’s description of “author and designer,” as she produces her own content as well as the visuals to go along with it.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do enjoy Rock’s message, that designers don’t necessarily need to be the authors of the concepts behind their designs. When I chose communication design as my major I hoped to help other people bring their messages to life, in my own unique style of course. I like the idea of having my own personal ideas and content that I can create and display on my own time, but also making a career out of designing for other people’s content if they cannot do so themselves. This reading helped me feel as though this goal of mine is, indeed, valid.
<br><br>
<em>Questions for class:<br><br>
1- Which do you imagine yourself as? A designer ​and​ author or a designer ​as​ an author? Do
you think one is more respected than the other?<br><br>
2- What did you think of the statement about Pop Art being advertising art? Do you think this portion of the text, in a way, brings up the question of the difference between art and design?</em><br><br><br><br>

<h3>Response to <a href="https://arena-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/6027003/fc77b9ec0ddfd0667fb7bb794d19cca0.pdf?1580276257"> Reinfurt Reading</a> (studio)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing this excerpt from Reinfurt’s book, I couldn’t help but notice an underlying theme throughout the text that was not directly addressed, but that connects nicely with Michael Rock’s “Fuck Content” piece. That was the theme of collaboration. Besides the many minute mentions of collaboration in the text— Reinfurt crediting his long-term design partner, Stuart Bertolotti-Bailey, for example— the overarching theme of the reading was how Reinfurt redesigned Donald Knuth’s Metafont for modern computers. I think this was a great example, tying back to Rock’s writing, of a designer not creating the main content or concept of their design, but building and improving upon someone else’s ideas to create something both people would likely be able to appreciate.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first notable mention of working in partnership to somebody else in this reading was when Knuth came up with his very particular idea for a new font, and after making his own attempts to create it, he realized that he did not have the specific skills to achieve his vision. Instead of giving up or simplifying his idea, Knuth found no problem in bringing professional letterform designers like Hermann Zapf into his project. His willingness to collaborate and hire experts ultimately brought his idea to life the way he envisioned. Not only does way of developing projects ensure more people have a chance to succeed in the design industry, but it’s also a great model to set for future creators and proof that two heads are better than one. Donald Knuth is obviously a very knowledgeable and extremely skilled man, and if he was alright with reaching out to others for help with his projects then anyone should be. Some people are born to be designers ​and​ authors, but not everyone should feel forced to bear the burden of both roles.<br><br><br>
<em>Questions for class:<br><br>
1- Do you view Knuth’s obsession with the typeface of his Computer Programming manual as an unnecessary extra worry, or an admirable example of his dedication to the quality of his work? How far do you have to go to make a work of quality?<br><br>
2- I wonder at what point a ridiculously long product name like ​Meta-the-difference-between-the- two-Font-4-D cross the line between novelty/charming and so long that it hinders its ability to succeed or be memorable. Do you need a certain already-standing level of popularity to successfully pull off something like that?</em><br><br><br><br>

<h3>Response to an <a href="http://saradebondt.com/"> Are.na Homepage</a> (lab)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While browsing Are.na for a homepage I found interesting I stumbled upon Sara De Bondt’s personal website. With a quick google search, I found that she is supposedly an author, although most of her works appear to be more visual and design-based to me. I was very drawn to her website because I thought it closely related to what we are currently doing in class, and I wouldn’t be surprised if one of my peers ended up creating a similar website. The site displays Bondt’s work one by one in an automatic slideshow. The images of each project are clean, fill up the full screen, and feature striking colors. I love how self-explanatory the site is, with just one image and a title per piece, she lets the works speak for themselves. Just by looking at her site I picture Sara De Bondt as talented, professional, and to-the-point. This sort of heavily visual-based simplicity is a goal I have for my own site and a big reason I appreciate Bondt’s. <br><br><br><br>


<h3>Response to <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/49/60004/too-much-world-is-the-internet-dead/"> Steyerl Reading</a> (studio)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Too Much World: Is the Internet Dead?” felt a bit like a glimpse into Hito Steyerl’s stream of consciousness. She asked so many rhetorical questions that I, at first thought I knew the answers to. ‘Of course the internet isn’t dead’, I thought, ‘the internet is everything’. But upon reading the author’s arguments for why I could be wrong, I started to realize how I misinterpreted the question. I still don’t think the internet is dead, but perhaps the internet as we once knew it is. Perhaps the internet has not died, but morphed into something even more modern and powerful.
Prior to this reading I thought the internet simply broadcast the events going on in the real world. But Steyerl has convinced me that the internet doesn’t only display images of reality, but shapes them as well. “Online is moving offline” in the sense that we can now manipulate so much from the web. For example, say the president’s twitter were to be hacked, that could result in war. So the internet would not only play a role in providing news of said war after it starts, but it would have also been the entire reason it started in the first place.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I got from the article is that the internet is no longer an escape from reality, but it is infiltrating our lives beyond the screens. And I feel that since you can’t trust what you see or read on the internet, now you can no longer trust what you see in the real world either. The internet is “the realm of complexity gone haywire” according to Steyerl. I do agree that we should be concerned about our world getting as out of control and insane as the internet has gotten, especially since it is a reflection of our own capabilities. Humans did this to ourselves after all.<br><br><br><br>



<h3>Response to <a href="https://interfacecritique.net/journal/test-retz"> Retzepi Reading</a> (studio)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My assumption that the relationship between human and technology has changed a great deal since the first home computers came out in the 1980’s was only reinforced after reading “You, the Users” by Kali Retzepi. This article opened my eyes to the idea that our role in relation to our gadgets and devices, which we are so closely attached to, will only become more and more confused as we continue to allow tech giants manipulate how we use their products. In the first section of the article, Retzepi writes, “​A certain vocabulary was built to cater to the needs of a user who is increasingly unaware of their role in a system that is built upon their choices, and is always hungry for more comfort and ease of mind.” This reflects on how we think we are controlling our devices when in reality we are being taught how to make them do what we want them to do, inherently making us the ones who are being controlled. We are slowly becoming as much of a predictable machine as our actual machines are.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retzepi suggests an interesting solution to this problem toward the end of the reading. She encourages us, the users, to step back from our desire to be lazy. She thinks we should no longer respond positively to the conveniences added to each new iphone. That we should not give in and purchase every upgraded version of the Google Home or Amazon Alexa, even if they can hear you from even farther away and give you answers even faster than the last model could. Retzepi thinks we should demand more playful, interesting, and even challenging interfaces. Perhaps I’m easily convinced, or perhaps I just want to see a world where we once again feel they same euphoric feeling towards computers as people felt towards drugs in the 60’s. But I agree with the author. I think demanding something new and different would not only
benefit our own minds, but break the cycle of huge software developers all competing to sell the same products as each other year after year. It would provide a challenge for companies as well as something new and interesting for the users. Now if only it were so easy to convince the world that they should deny the convenience and laziness we are so easily sold.<br><br><br><br>
