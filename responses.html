<p>Response to an Are.na homepage~ <br></p>
<p>While browsing Are.na for a homepage I found interesting I stumbled upon Sara De Bondt’s personal website. With a quick google search, I found that she is supposedly an author, although most of her works appear to be more visual and design-based to me. I was very drawn to her website because I thought it closely related to what we are currently doing in class, and I wouldn’t be surprised if one of my peers ended up creating a similar website. The site displays Bondt’s work one by one in an automatic slideshow. The images of each project are clean, fill up the full screen, and feature striking colors. I love how self-explanatory the site is, with just one image and a title per piece, she lets the works speak for themselves. Just by looking at her site I picture Sara De Bondt as talented, professional, and to-the-point. This sort of heavily visual-based simplicity is a goal I have for my own site and a big reason I appreciate Bondt’s. <br>
